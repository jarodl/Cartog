A simple level editor.

## Layers

Layers should be used for separate environment elements (water on
one layer, ground on another, etc).

## Colors

Right now colors are only used to make it easier on the user. The way
they are stored on export is not very friendly if you want to use them
to distinguish between elements.

## Saving

Local storage support is coming soon. For now, hitting save only preps
the level for export.
